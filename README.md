# Plain JS Refactoring

This repository is an example repository about refactoring a piece of plain JS into a structured and testable system of files and components.

## Initial

The `initial` folder contains the file that is then refactored.

## Step 0

The `step_0` folder contains a simple split of the file into logical blocks.

## Step 1

The `step_1` folder contains a "pseudo OOP" implementation of the blocks. It's structured, but it isn't testable almost at all as the constructors of the methods contain side effects.

## Step 2 (Functional)

The `step_2_func` folder contains a functional implementation of the same page with tests and properly structured functional modules.

## Step 2 (OOP)

The `step_2_oop` folder contains a object-oriented implementation of the same page with tests and properly structured class modules.
